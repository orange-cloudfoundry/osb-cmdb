== Service Bindings

By default, Spring Cloud App Broker does not include functionality for managing bindings to its service instances. App Broker provides interfaces which service broker authors can implement to control service bindings.

//TODO: Move App Broker API docs base to AsciiDoc attribute.

=== Creating a Service Binding

The service broker application must implement the https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-app-broker/docs/1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/api/org/springframework/cloud/appbroker/service/CreateServiceInstanceAppBindingWorkflow.html[`CreateServiceInstanceAppBindingWorkflow`] interface.

=== Deleting a Service Binding

The service broker application must implement the https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-app-broker/docs/1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/api/org/springframework/cloud/appbroker/service/DeleteServiceInstanceBindingWorkflow.html[`DeleteServiceInstanceBindingWorkflow`] interface.
