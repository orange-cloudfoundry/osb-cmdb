== Deployment Platforms

You can configure details of deployment platforms in App Broker configuration properties. These properties are under `spring.cloud.appbroker.deployer`. Currently, Spring Cloud App Broker supports only Cloud Foundry as a deployment platform.

To configure a Cloud Foundry deployment platform, use properties under `spring.cloud.appbroker.deployer.cloudfoundry`, as in the following example:

[source,yaml,subs="+quotes"]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    appbroker:
      deployer:
        *cloudfoundry:*
          *api-host: api.sys.example.com*
          *api-port: 443*
          *username: admin*
          *password: adminpass*
          *client-id: EXAMPLE_ID*
          *client-secret: EXAMPLE_SECRET*
          *default-org: test*
          *default-space: development*
----

NOTE: The two properties `username` and `password` and the two properties `client-id` and `client-secret` are mutually exclusive. The `client-id` and `client-secret` properties are for use with OAuth 2.0.
