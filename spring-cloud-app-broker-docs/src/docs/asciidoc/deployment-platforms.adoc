== Deployment Platforms

You can configure details of deployment platforms in App Broker configuration properties. These properties are under `spring.cloud.appbroker.deployer`. Currently, Spring Cloud App Broker supports only Cloud Foundry as a deployment platform.

To configure a Cloud Foundry deployment platform, use properties under `spring.cloud.appbroker.deployer.cloudfoundry`, as in the following example:

```yml
spring:
  cloud:
    appbroker:
      deployer:
        *cloudfoundry:*
          *api-host: api.sys.example.com*
          *api-port: 443*
          *username: admin*
          *password: adminpass*
          *default-org: test*
          *default-space: development*
```
