## Osb-cmdb-spike

This repo contains a spike for the osb-cmdb project.

This project provides a configuration management for Open Service Broker API implementation.

At this stage of the spike, this is a fork of the [https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-app-broker]( spring-cloud/spring-cloud-app-broker) project (referred as SCAB).

Plan is to work with the SCAB team to contribute upstream osb-cmdb's changes to SCAB, and move osb-cmdb in its own repo which would pull SCAB from maven central.
