The [impl-notes](impl-notes) directory contains implementation notes for each feature.

Implementation notes aggregate a TODO list, a kind of break downstructure. 

It contains some details about symptoms, problems encountered, and alternatives considered.

Goal of these logs is to be able to grep symptoms that are don't typically endup into code, or rationales for design/impl choices. 

The issues in the backlog provide high level priorization.
The TODO.md list smaller product enhancement items and technical debt items.
